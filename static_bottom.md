## Hacking

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create background images:

```bash
node index.js
```

If the image is already present in the `/images` directory, then it will be skipped. To add a new area just edit locations.js adding a new entry using the correct latitude, longitude, and zoom level. 🤘🏻
