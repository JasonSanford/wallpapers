# Topo Wallpapers

These are pre-rendered wallpapers of some areas of interesting topography. To use them just head down to [downloads](#downloads) and pick a location and style. Each area has a wallpaper for each combination of:

* Color - dark or green
* AllTrails logo - present or not
* Screen size - phone or laptop

The dark style works well for a home screen wallpaper. The green style is a little distracting for a home screen but works for a lock screen.
